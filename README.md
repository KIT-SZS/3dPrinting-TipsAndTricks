========================


This is a series of , well, tips and tricks related to 3d printing, most specifically at the SZS:



Steps

Introduction to 3d printing:

Machines(building machine!):
============================

Currently at the lab: 

- K8200 : print quality is not perfect, reliability is ok 
- Ultimaker 2: print quality can be very high, almost "plug and print". Main issue : filament driver not putting out enough filament for prints with layer height >= 0.2. Best suited for 0.1 mm layer heights


**tip** watch , analyze, adjust, instead of restarting the print : most prints can be "saved" : you will not have industrial quality parts from the start, but if a part "works" , all is fine !

Slicing
=======

- **Cura** is a good and fast slicer, very beginner friendly, with quite a lot of advanced features if you need them
- **Slic3r** is also a very good slic3r, perhaps a bit harder for beginners

**tip** : I have already set up profiles for both machines in Cura , use them/modify them to taste
**IMPORTANT**: do not use GCodes meant for a machine in another machine : ***GCODE IS MACHINE SPECIFIC !!!***
